The idea of this project is to build a Chip8 emulator using Rust.
I've never made an emulator before but it looks like a really interesting project.
I've decided to pick Chip8 as it's what looks like the recommended emulator to first try but I would like to make a NES emulator in the future, maybe even a GameBoy emulator.

The idea is to develop this emulator to work for web and desktop as I want to take that challenge and learn about the great WASM compatibility of Rust using it.
So, the first step is to look into the documentation and learn about the system that I want to replicate, see you when I start writting some code.
