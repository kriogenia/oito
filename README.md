# Oito
Oito is a recreation project that I wanted to make in my free time.
I always had interest on emulation so I decided to make my own Chip8 emulator, 
the first step to anyone wanting to join the emulation world.

I will try to make at the same time a diary of my work with this emulator.
You can find it over [bitacora](/bitacora), each chapter will also represent the different parts of the development and will contain all my thoughs and decisions around those parts.

**Hope you like it**.
